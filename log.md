# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Created the repo for the toy project. Set up command line argument parsing to get the country slug from the user. Chose to use the [Coronavirus COVID19 API](https://covid19api.com), which has good documentation. Made the API call and figured out how to process the response body JSON. Used goroutines and a channel to get the different statuses.

**Thoughts:** I've done a lot of Golang tutorials and reading over the last year, but I'm really excited to build something that is mostly fun and semi-useful. The COVID19 pandemic is bascically going to dominate much of our lives for at least the next while, so I thought why not let something positive come out of it and learn something new.
